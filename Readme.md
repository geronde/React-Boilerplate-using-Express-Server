# React BoilerPlate

A simple boilerplate that you can use as a template for your React apps. It's fast, easy to implement and modify.

It uses Webpack, Express Server, babel, react hot loading and more to handle and compile modules into plain javascript and other static assets. It also supports Redux as a state manager.
